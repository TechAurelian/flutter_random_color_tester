# Flutter Random Color Tester

A basic Flutter project that tests the [flutter_randomcolor](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_randomcolor) Dart package for generating attractive random colors.

flutter_randomcolor is a Dart port of David Merfield's [randomColor](https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor) JavaScript utility.

Flutter Random Color Tester is actually a Flutter web app that you can run in your browser to generate dozens or hundreds of attractive random colors. You can select options to influence the type of color it produces and copy the generated colors to the clipboard for reuse in other apps or places.

Just open https://frctester.techaurelian.com in your browser to give it a try.
